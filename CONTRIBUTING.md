## How to add your name to the project's contributor list
To learn how to add your name to this project's contributor list, you can get started <a href="https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines"> here </a>.

what needs worked on: (add/edit things that need fixed/done, there is probably more than what is listed below- don't forget to delete things you fixed/finished)

## react-based site
- register button on signup page throws error, but it does validate the email & checks that passwords match
- signin button on login page doesn't work- when register & signin are working load at login page- or make landing page 
- connect book tracker w/ wish list, reading list and add book page - should autopopulate when user resigns in
- add book should add book to wish list or reading list- should be able to move book from wish list to reading list
- add way to show progress... maybe have list # of pages in book then let the user mark the number of pages that they have read and have it calculate how far they are in the book using that data 

## vanilla-js site
- newsletter only option under browse that works
- newsletter page needs more to it- currently just a page that says to subscribe to newsletter
- most newletter page links/buttons don't work- submit sort of works gives message saying too many requests for the newletter & login&homepage links work
- login button gives no reponse-needs fixed- once verified should take to site- if info is wrong should give some kind of feedback
- need to check that passwords match from password input and repeat password inputs
- register button should store info and take you to the site- currently only gives pop up saying you registered
- add button doesn't appear to do anything- should add book to users 'file' - maybe consider adding a rating for when book is finished and an option to comment on it with a check box saying whether the rating and comment can be shared with other users
- top ten should show books the ten books with the highest ratings
- trending should show books that the most people are reading
- database should check if book is in it- if not add it and mark that someone is reading it- if so then add another person to reading it- should also store ratings that the book was given and comments made about the book
- search should allow users to look at books in database and see ratings and comments- maybe an option for users to add/edit a brief description of what the book is about - give it a max number of words/characters
-  allow users to add books to new releases- but they need to include publication date- if it is more than so old it can't go on- whenever someone logs on site it should check the books on new releases and take off ones that are too old
