## Description

**The Amazing Book Tracker** is a web-based application created by students from the [Zero To Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/).

The goal of the app is to provide users with a means to manage their book collections.

End users can record the books they've previously read, books they want to read; as well as the books they're currently reading.

## Functionality

Users should be able to sign up as new members by filling out a registration form.

After joining, they should be able to log in as an existing user.

Users should be able to add a book to the system.

Users should be able to place books on 3 separate lists:

1. Books they've already read
2. Books they want to read
3. Books they are currently reading.

Finally, users should be able to easily navigate through these separate lists.
